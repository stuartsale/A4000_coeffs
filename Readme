Tables for converting from A_4000 to passband extinctions
============================================================

Author - Stuart Sale

Intro
------------

The tables provided here can be used to convert from A_4000, the
monochromatic extinction at 4000A, to extinction in a range of 
commonly used photometric bands following equation 11 of Sale & 
Magorrian (2014b):

A_X = c^{(1)}_X A_{4000} + c^{(2)}_X A_{4000}^2 .

Each file is for a particular extinction law from Fitzpatrick (2004),
for example 21_curves.out is for the Fitzpatrick 'R_V=2.1' law.
Note that in general R_V != R_5495 .

Within each file the column format is:

col 1: the spectrum employed, either the spectral type or Rayleigh-Jeans
col 2: The T_eff of the spectrum used
col 3: the log g of the spectrum used
col 4-115: the coefficiants c^{(1)}_X and c^{(2)}_X for a range of filters

For each filter there are two columns, e.g. A_J_2MASS_1 and 
A_J_2MASS_2, where A_J_2MASS_1 corresponds to alpha and A_J_2MASS_2 to
beta.

The range of filters covered is given in table A1 of Sale & Magorrian 
(2014b).

For some filter/spectrum combinations values are not available - the
corresponding values are given as 'NAN'.

These tables acompany Sale & Magorrian, 2014, 'Marginal likelihoods of
